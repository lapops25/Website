    <h3>Lyrics</h3>
    <pre>
        What would I do without your smart mouth?
        Drawing me in, and you kicking me out
        You've got my head spinning, no kidding, I can't pin you down
        What's going on in that beautiful mind?
        I'm on your magical mystery ride
        And I'm so dizzy, don't know what hit me, but I'll be alright
        My head's under water
        But I'm breathing fine
        You're crazy and I'm out of my mind

        'Cause all of me
        Loves all of you
        Love your curves and all your edges
        All your perfect imperfections
        Give your all to me
        I'll give my all to you
        You're my end and my beginning
        Even when I lose, I'm winning
        'Cause I give you all of me
        And you give me all of you, oh-oh

        How many times do I have to tell you?
        Even when you're crying, you're beautiful too
        The world is beating you down, I'm around through every mood
        You're my downfall, you're my muse
        My worst distraction, my rhythm and blues
        I can't stop singing, it's ringing in my head for you
        My head's under water
        But I'm breathing fine
        You're crazy and I'm out of my mind

        'Cause all of me
        Loves all of you
        Love your curves and all your edges
        All your perfect imperfections
        Give your all to me
        I'll give my all to you
        You're my end and my beginning
        Even when I lose, I'm winning

        'Cause I give you all of me
        And you give me all of you, oh-oh
        Give me all of you, oh
        Cards on the table, we're both showing hearts
        Risking it all, though it's hard
        'Cause all of me
        Loves all of you
        Love your curves and all your edges
        All your perfect imperfections
        Give your all to me
        I'll give my all to you
        You're my end and my beginning
        Even when I lose, I'm winning
        'Cause I give you all of me
        And you give me all of you
        I give you all of me
        And you give me all of you, oh-oh
